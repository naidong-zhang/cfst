# Brief Overview

- `server` folder is backend using Flask.
- `client` folder is a Python framework called Kivy. I intended to develop Mobile App without using Java for Android or Swift before I went to Red River College. However, now I can use React Native to do the same job.
- `models` folder contains AI models optimized using OpenVINO. The VPS I purchased at a quite low price is based on Alibaba Cloud, which uses Intel CPUs so I can deploy these models on the Cloud.
